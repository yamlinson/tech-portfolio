      I'm a systems engineer skilled in Linux servers, AWS, networking, and software development.
      I consider security in everything I do
      and I believe a task isn't truly complete until it is automated.

      I'm passionate about IT systems, software, and the intersection of the two.

      I have over 5 years of professional experience in IT operations including security analysis,
      software development, software deployment, systems engineering, and systems administration.

      I hold a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, which I earned after originally completing
      a Bachelor of Music in Music Performance.

      I also have 15+ years of amateur experience writing software, hosting game servers, tinkering with Linux,
      and much more! These are the subjects of this site.

      I'm also a classically trained saxophonist and amateur photographer and would love to chat about those things!
